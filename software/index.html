        As a Full Stack Software Engineer at Booz Allen Hamilton, I build high-throughput event pipelines with Kafka, Terraform, and Kubernetes. I also develop and maintain React micro-frontends and NodeJS APIs that interact with both SQL and NoSQL systems.
        <br><br>Previously, working with the NIST Grice Marine Lab at the College of Charleston, I migrated a proteomics database to the cloud and built a responsive React UI for researchers. With my peers, I also developed a donation platform (React/Django/AWS) with dynamic suggestions based on user behavior.
        <br><br>Earlier work in data science focused on bug pattern analysis using graph theory and artificial intelligence—published in IEEE APSEC ’21.
